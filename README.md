# ViSTA Virtual Simulation Results Data Examples

## Introduction
This repository contains examples of virtual simulation results data in the ViSTA data format. These examples were generated by CETRAN team using VIRES VTD simulator, after post-processing, based on a simple "obstacle avoidance" scenario and 3 different behaviors of a Vehicle Under Test (VUT) on a virtual model of the CETRAN AV test track, Singapore. (2021-11-25).

These examples along with the format itself is referenced in the guidelines document titled [**Simulation Assessment Guidelines towards Independent Safety Assurance of Autonomous Vehicles**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00924) created by CETRAN and the Land Transport Authority of Singapore. For a detailed description of the format and its various fields, please refer to this document.

This format is also used in the ViSTA simulation framework, developed by CETRAN as described [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.02529).
