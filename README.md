# ViSTA Virtual Simulation Results Data Examples
Examples of virtual simulation results data in the ViSTA data format. These examples were generated by CETRAN team using VIRES VTD simulator, after post-processing, based on a simple "obstacle avoidance" scenario and 3 different behaviors of a Vehicle Under Test (VUT) on a virtual model of the CETRAN AV test track, Singapore. (2021-11-25).

The format is used for logging data from the ViSTA simulation framework (also developed by CETRAN) as presented here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.02529
